<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Anushka, and I'm truly passionate about two things: coding and art. From a young age, I've always been drawn to the creative process, whether it's crafting lines of code or wielding a paintbrush. Coding isn't just a skill for me; it's a form of expression. I love the thrill of problem-solving and the endless possibilities of creating something from scratch with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>
But my creative journey doesn't end there. Art has been a constant companion in my life, offering me a different avenue for self-expression. Whether it's painting, drawing, or sculpting, I find solace and joy in bringing my imagination to life on canvas or paper.
</p>
<p>
What truly excites me is the intersection of coding and art. Exploring the world of creative coding allows me to blend my two passions seamlessly, creating interactive digital art pieces that captivate and inspire.
</p>
<p>
In every project I undertake, whether it's writing code or wielding a paintbrush, my goal is the same: to infuse my work with passion, creativity, and a touch of magic. Because to me, coding and art aren't just hobbiesâ€”they're a way of life.
